Any Question Any Place is a platform to solve tasks with LLM and CV in an interactive way. For example the input is (1) satellite image of storage tanks, (2) a question about the image, e.g. “how many storage tanks are there with >5m diameter”?. LLM acts as an expert to response to users' linguistic requests based on the input remote sensing image, and calls different tools for different tasks. It supports various interpretation tasks that are trained on remote sensing datasets. To help LLM better understand remote sensing knowledge, remote sensing image captioning is set as cue to help LLM understand remote sensing image.
